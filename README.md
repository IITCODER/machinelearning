ONLY ONE CODE AND LEARN ALL SUBJECTS IN ENGINEERING:                                                                                                                *We are designing a tool based on studentsâ€™ marks distribution that will help them understand and track their progress in key areas throughout their four years of B.Tech life on campus.*

The tool will focus on multiple domains of learning and skill development, including:

1. *Mathematics*
2.*Coding and Programming (Python)*
3. *Artificial Intelligence*
4. *Data Science*
5. *Data Analytics*
6. *Data Visualization*
7. *Machine Learning*
8. *Deep Learning*
9. *Natural Language Processing (NLP)*
10. *Large Language Models (LLMs)*
11. *Research and Project Work*

This system will allow students to visualize their performance, identify strengths and weaknesses, and progressively build expertise in these areas semester by semester. By mapping marks distribution to skill areas, the tool provides a clear roadmap for growth, ensuring that students are prepared for both academic excellence and real-world challenges.                                              https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WltTi1FpujREpqUIR-PAh6mngvxWbIqy?usp=sharing
